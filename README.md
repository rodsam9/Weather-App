# Overview

Want to know the temperature in the city you live? Well this app can help you know what the temperature is like in your city. You just type the city as input, click submit, and let the app do the rest for you! It's like magic! It'll display the temperature in farenheit. Enjoy!
{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running (starting the server and navigating through the web pages) and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Web Pages

In this project I created 2 webpages. The first page is for the user to type input in and click submit. Once submit is clicked, it fetches api from openweathermaps, then the page switches to the results webpage that I created, which displays the tempereature of the city that the user input in. I used this method called 'POST' which switches the webpages when certain thing is done, such as clicking the submit button.
# Development Environment

The tools that I used were python, html, css, and flask.

To complete this project I had to download some of the following libraries; requests, configparser, flask.

# Future Work

* I'd like to add a weekly report of what the weather will be like.
* I can add a description describing if its cloudy, rainy, sunny, etc.
* I would love to add more CSS and the web app for appealing.
